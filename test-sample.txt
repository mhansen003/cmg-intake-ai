CMG CHANGE REQUEST - URGENT

Title: SmartApp Document Upload Enhancement

Description:
We need to update the SmartApp platform to support bulk document uploads for loan processing.
Currently, loan officers can only upload one document at a time, which is causing significant
delays in the processing workflow.

This enhancement will integrate with the Document Vendor system and add automated document
classification using OCR technology. The feature needs to support PDF, JPEG, and PNG formats.

The change will impact the Processing and Underwriting teams, as they will be the primary users
of this new functionality. We also need to update the Automation platform to trigger automatic
document categorization workflows.

This affects the Retail and Wholesale channels primarily, though the JV channel may also benefit
from these improvements.

Additional Requirements:
- Support for batch uploads (up to 50 documents)
- Real-time progress indicators
- Integration with existing Clear Docs system
- Notification system for failed uploads
- Audit trail for compliance tracking

Expected Completion: Q1 2025
Priority: High
Requested by: Processing Department Lead
